    <textarea id="input">&#9;An initial reading of John Keats’ “When I have fears that I may cease to be” gives a comforting, albeit depressing, image of a speaker who realizes that his accomplishments are meaningless as he nears his death. However, a closer reading of the form and diction of the sonnet reveals a larger argument about ideas and poetry in general. Specifically, Keats argues that poetry is an insufficient medium for expressing ones ideas, as ideas are temporal and individualistic by nature.&#10;&#10;&#9;Keats’ poem can be broken down into two sections: the first three quatrains, where the speaker expresses his fear of dying young and failing to fulfill his goals as a writer and lover; and the final couplet, where Keats concludes that this fear is irrational because love and fame are always temporary. The first quatrain establishes a metaphor between harvesting grain and writing poetry. The metaphor both compares Keats’ work to a “harvest” which has to be harvested, and to Keats himself as a harvester who has limited time to produce “grain” (poetry). The speaker is not merely worried about death, but rather that he may not achieve his full creative potential (“high pil’d books” (3)) before he dies. Reinforcing this idea is the use of alliteration in the key words “grain”, “garners”, and “glean’d,” which makes the section seem almost rehearsed. Because the entire first quatrain is preceded by “When I have fears that I may cease to be” (1), it as if the ideas that follow are only relevant as long as the speaker is living.&#10;&#10;&#9;The second set of four lines builds on the ideas from the first, as the speaker “beholds, upon the night’s starr’d face, / Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance” and fears that he “may never live to trace / Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance” (5-8). The “romance” here is not referring to love in the classical sense, but rather to the great poets before Keats who are now immortalized in the sky. The speaker fears that the “magic hand of chance” (8) will cut his life short and prevent him from being able to join these writers. At the same time, the “magic hand of a chance” may refer to his own hand which does not even have time to “trace the shadows” of those other great writers.&#10;&#10;&#9;The speaker turns to love in the third quatrain, speaking directly to a “fair creature of an hour” (9). He fears that he will never have a chance to “relish in the faery power” of this love, while at the same time he realizes that the love is “of an hour” and will soon end. In the final line of the quatrain, the speaker goes on to say that this romance is “unreflecting” (12), which may allude to the final couplet where Keats concludes that love is an illusion. This final stanza is cut short to only three and a half lines, and the section as a whole is shorter than the section about poetry. Moreover, the emotional undertones of this section (“I feel”) make it convey less weight than the confidence of the first two quatrains. Perhaps Keats is speaking to the relative importance of poetry and love in his life—he does not even devote a whole quatrain to love in this poem.&#10;&#10;&#9;Following the mid-line volta in line 12, the speaker arrives at the conclusion that humans are, by nature, solitary creations that “stand alone” (13). Thus, as the speaker stands on the “shore” (12) between life and death, he sees that “Love and Fame” (14) are simply worldly desires that do not hold significance past his death. Thus, he resolves his anxiety by observing that death turns everything into nothing, and so there is no reason to stress about fame and love, as even art will lose its significance upon ones death.
