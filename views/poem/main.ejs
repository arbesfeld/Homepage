    <textarea id="input">&#9;An initial reading of John Keats’ “When I have fears that I may cease to be” gives a comforting, albeit depressing, image of a speaker who realizes that his accomplishments are meaningless as he nears his death. However, a closer reading of the form and diction of the sonnet reveals a larger argument about ideas and poetry in general. Specifically, Keats argues that poetry is an insufficient medium for expressing ones ideas, as ideas are temporal and individualistic by nature.&#10;&#10;&#9;Keats’ poem can be broken down into two sections: the first three quatrains, where the speaker expresses his fear of dying young and failing to fulfill his goals as a writer and lover; and the final couplet, where Keats concludes that this fear is irrational because love and fame are always temporary. The first quatrain establishes a metaphor between harvesting grain and writing poetry. The metaphor both compares Keats’ work to a “harvest” which has to be harvested, and to Keats himself as a harvester who has limited time to produce “grain” (poetry). The speaker is not merely worried about death, but rather that he may not achieve his full creative potential (“high pil’d books” (3)) before he dies. Reinforcing this idea is the use of alliteration in the key words “grain”, “garners”, and “glean’d,” which makes the section seem almost rehearsed. Because the entire first quatrain is preceded by “When I have fears that I may cease to be” (1), it as if the ideas that follow are only relevant as long as the speaker is living.&#10;&#10;&#9;The second set of four lines builds on the ideas from the first, as the speaker “beholds, upon the night’s starr’d face, / Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance” and fears that he “may never live to trace / Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance” (5-8). The “romance” here is not referring to love in the classical sense, but rather to the great poets before Keats who are now immortalized in the sky. The speaker fears that the “magic hand of chance” (8) will cut his life short and prevent him from being able to join these writers. At the same time, the “magic hand of a chance” may refer to his own hand which does not even have time to “trace the shadows” of those other great writers.&#10;&#10;&#9;The speaker turns to love in the third quatrain, speaking directly to a “fair creature of an hour” (9). He fears that he will never have a chance to “relish in the faery power” of this love, while at the same time he realizes that the love is “of an hour” and will soon end. In the final line of the quatrain, the speaker goes on to say that this romance is “unreflecting” (12), which may allude to the final couplet where Keats concludes that love is an illusion. This final stanza is cut short to only three and a half lines, and the section as a whole is shorter than the section about poetry. Moreover, the emotional undertones of this section (“I feel”) make it convey less weight than the confidence of the first two quatrains. Perhaps Keats is speaking to the relative importance of poetry and love in his life—he does not even devote a whole quatrain to love in this poem.&#10;&#10;&#9;Following the mid-line volta in line 12, the speaker arrives at the conclusion that humans are, by nature, solitary creations that “stand alone” (13). Thus, as the speaker stands on the “shore” (12) between life and death, he sees that “Love and Fame” (14) are simply worldly desires that do not hold significance past his death. Thus, he resolves his anxiety by observing that death turns everything into nothing, and so there is no reason to stress about fame and love, as even art will lose its significance upon ones death.&#10;&#10;&#9;Although a linear interpretation of the poem may give the impression that the speaker is building up to a grand conclusion in the final couplet, the structure and form of the entire sonnet speaks to the nihilism of the ending. The poem is a Shakespearean sonnet, which makes the reader expect a highly structured narrative. However, the poem reads more as stream of consciousness which has been manipulated to fit the Shakespearean sonnet form. This sonnet form seems to be inadequate for expressing the ideas of the narrator. In fact, during the moments of the speaker’s greatest realizations, he breaks out of the sonnet form. For example, the lines that contain the most powerful revelations, such as “Till Love and Fame to nothinginess do sink” (14) and “Never have relish in the faery power” (11), have an extra stressed syllable as compared to the iambic pentameter of the rest of the poem.  At the end of the third quatrain, the speaker once again breaks out of the classic sonnet form by starting “the turn” earlier than expected. It is as if the speaker’s ideas are too unpredictable and fluctuating to fit into a sonnet. The insufficiency of the poetic form for expressing ones ideas relates to the speaker’s conclusion at the end of the poem. The speaker concludes that “Love and Fame to nothinginess do sink”—because even if he were to produce “the full-ripen’d grain” of “high-pil’d books”, there is no way that all of his ideas could be captured in poetic form.&#10;&#10;&#9;Not only is it impossible for the speaker to poeticize all of his ideas, but the diction of “When I have fears” suggests that ideas are actually only valid for a certain period of time. The “grain” metaphor of the first quatrain likens ideas to “rich garners [of] full-ripen’d grain” (4). The metaphor suggests that an accomplished life consists of producing enough poetry (“grain”) to fill high pil’d books (“rich garners”). However, grain goes bad in under a year. Perhaps this choice of metaphor suggests that all ideas are temporary. Thus, (as the speaker realizes at the end of the poem), it is futile to try to capture all of ones ideas in poetry, as these ideas will inevitably “go bad” as times change.&#10;&#10;&#9;The concept of the transitory nature of ideas continues in the second quatrain, when the speaker compares the old great writers to “Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance” (6). Clouds are even more temporary than grain, and thus the implication is that great writers are as easily forgotten as clouds. Moreover, such ideas are created through the “magic hand of chance” (8)—suggesting that ideas are formulated by chance. Not only are ideas indefinite like “clouds”, but their creation is based on luck.&#10;&#10;&#9;Underlining the temporal nature of ideas is the use of the word “when” in Keats’ poem.  All of the ideas in the poem are preceded by a “when” modifier, which makes them only relevant when the “when” clause is fulfilled. “When” also relates the ideas to a specific time, demonstrating Keats’ understanding that ideas are only relevant in the time that they are formulated. This realization seems to satisfy the speaker, as worrying about writing down all of ones ideas is meaningless when such ideas will be irrelevant in another period of time. The use of “I” in the poem has a similar function, in that it shows that ideas are usually only important to the individual that constructs them. The poem is only concerned with a singular character; it does not try to make statements about people in general. Thus, ideas are not only restricted to a single moment in time, but also to a distinct individual.&#10;&#10;&#9;In the speaker’s point of view, even love is meaningless and illusory. Just as ideas are based in time, love is merely a “fair creation of an hour”. Moreover, such love is “unreflecting,” implying that we are not even satisfied by love in the moment! Just as ideas are temporary, love is fleeting and transient.&#10;&#10;&#9;Throughout the entirety of “When I have Fears that I may cease to be,” Keats argues that our two main worldly desires—expressing ones ideas and finding love—are futile exercises, as they are concerned only with a definite time and a specific individual. As such, it is impossible to use poetry to properly express ones ideas about life and love. While such a conclusion seems depressing, the speaker of the poem finds solace in this fact. The speaker concludes that worrying about ideas and love is ultimately meaningless—our ideas will inevitably lose their significance over time, and no one loves us, anyway!
