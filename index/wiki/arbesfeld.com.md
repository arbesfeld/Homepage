Hi, I'm Matt! I am currently a sophomore studying Course 6-2: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Course 18: Mathematics at MIT.

Though likely not up to date, I use this site to keep track of my various ongoing projects. Feel free to contact me at (my last name)@gmail.com if you have any questions. (or if you know a good recipe for pad thai)
